<h4>Coal is the single biggest contributor to anthropogenic climate change. The burning of coal is responsible for 46% of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide and accounts for 72% of total  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the electricity sector.  
<br>If plans to build up to 1200 new coal fired power stations around the world are realized, the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from these plants would put us on a path towards catastrophic climate change, causing global temperatures to rise by over five degrees Celsius by 2100. This will have dire impacts for all life on earth. </h4>

<h2>HOW CAN I HELP?</h2>
<h3>Conserve Energy</h3>
<h4>People can do simple things to decrease energy consumption. Energy consumption can be reduced by simply turning off lights when a room is not in use, replacing light bulbs with longer-lasting fluorescent bulbs and only running air conditioning when a home is occupied. Other steps to reduce fossil fuel reliance include ensuring your home has efficient insulation for heating and cooling purposes and using Energy Star-rated consumer appliances. The Energy Star label is awarded to efficient products that reduce the total amount of energy used and typically display a calculated year’s savings as a percentage or dollar amount to help inform consumers.</h4><br>
<h3>Reuse Products</h3><br>
<h4>Many consumer goods can be reused instead of discarded. For example, use a fabric grocery shopping bag instead of paper or plastic. Reusable glass plates and cups will also reduce the amount of Styrofoam and plastics that require fossil fuel resources. When shopping, you can also buy post-consumer manufactured goods made from recycled materials. Some products such as computer printer ink cartridges may also be refilled and reused.</h4><br>
<h3>Recycle Materials</h3><br>
<h4>The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 75 percent of American waste is recyclable. You can help reduce the reliance on fossil fuels by recycling your waste instead of sending it to a landfill. Donate working products such as microwaves, lights, fans, clothing that no longer fits and household goods you no longer want to charities like Goodwill instead of throwing them away. It’s also a good idea to participate in your city’s recycling programs that provide trash bins for plastics, aluminum and paper.</h4><br>
<h3>Live Green</h3><br>
<h4>One solution to the depletion of nonrenewable fossil fuel usage is to go green. Going green means living your life in a way that sustains current resources for future generations. Green living always seeks to find a balance between humans and natural surroundings. This lifestyle choice focuses on respecting the environment by using as few resources as necessary; consuming only the food and energy needed for survival; participating in recycling programs that reduce municipal solid waste; using green energy electricity services such as solar power, which reduces pollution; and working together with other community members to ensure your children and grandchildren get to experience the same high-quality life. Communities can also go green by encouraging local lawmakers and planning agencies to create walkable neighborhoods where human interactions are favored over cars that pollute the air.</h4><br>
