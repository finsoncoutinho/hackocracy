<h4>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and halons destroy the earth's protective ozone layer, which shields the earth from harmful ultraviolet (UV-B) rays generated from the sun. CFCs and HCFCs also warm the lower atmosphere of the earth, changing global climate. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) also act to warm the planet. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) is working with industry, residents and government to reduce the damage done to the ozone layer and global climate by CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs and related chemicals.
<br>
HFCs, CFCs and HFCs contribute an estimated 11.5% to present-day effect of GHGs on climate and climate change.  Some effects of global climate change include:
• Rising sea levels
• Local natural species extinctions and habitat loss
• More frequent heavy rainfall and flooding
• High heat stress in summer
• Increasing health risk from insect and water-borne diseases

<h2>HOW CAN I HELP?</h2>
<h3>Dont use HCFCs as refrigerant</h3>
<h4>Buy air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment that do not use HCFCs as refrigerant.To avoid the use and emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a variety of climate-friendly, energy-efficient, safe and proven alternatives are available.Due to different thermodynamic and safety properties of the alternatives, there is no ’one size fits all’ solution. The suitability of a certain alternative must be considered separately for each category of product and equipment and in some cases also take into account the geographical location where the product and equipment is being used.Also buy aerosol products that do not use HCFCs or CFCs as propellants.

</h4><br>
<h3>Regular Inspection</h3><br>
<h4>Conduct regular inspection and maintenance of air-conditioning and refrigeration appliances to prevent and minimize refrigerant leakage.
</h4><br>
<h3>Replacing</h3><br>
<h4>For existing air-conditioning and refrigeration appliances that operate on HCFCs or CFCs, the refrigerant should be recovered or recycled whenever an overhaul of equipment is to be carried out. Replacing or retrofitting such equipment to operate on non-HCFCs refrigerant should also be considered. </h4><br>
